This engine is an open source solution to creating highly efficient
*retro* **OpenGL** games under ***Windows/Linux(when i get stuff together..)***. And mainly my insane solution
to achieving certain oddly specific techniques. It's fun sometimes. *Sometimes.*

## Monroe's Features

* **OpenGL 4.6**! (not used to the fullest)
* **GNU99** standard.
* **.7z** archive asset support.

## Libraries Used / Dependencies

* *sokol_gfx.h*
* *sokol_app.h*
* *cute_sound.h*
* *cute_png.h*
* *cimgui.h*
* *HandmadeMath.h*

This is a VS2019 proj. You know what to do if you use it...

## License

MIT. All I'm owned is a shout out. Go nuts!

### Should I actually use this?

***I DON'T THINK SO.*** It's bare, stupid, and made for lunatics who obsess over
minute graphical details and techniques in games, of which I'm the arguably most.

Take this more as reference for how these can be done. Not for how to do them *well*.
