* Render text. Can you?
* Add `cute_sound.h` back in you monster!
* `mnr_sprite` thingy. Will include model matrix so it'd be convinient to wrap that stuff as funcs.
* Ripoff INI load/save/writting. Call it `RNI`!

# Helpful Notes
On Lua, General Scripting:
I won't implement scripting currently because I don't really need it. TWRL uses dialogue and very
minor logic regarding interactions. My philosophy is that "If you don't need that, maybe don't put it
in!"
Even if I do work on scripting, it's possible I may create something myself to deal with the problem.
Who knows?
